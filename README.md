# Model-evaluation
Python scripts used to do model evaluation for Ms. project

To run the scripts it is suggested to use conda environments and set up the environment "model-evaluations" that follows the code. To set the environment follow these instructions https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file 

All files should be in the same directory and that directory should contain the directories containing the data. The script main.py is the only script that needs to be run by python, other scripts are functions utilised by main.py. All changes to modify which variables are plotted and what time period is plotted are made in main.py

This is a work in progress and not a finished code, so a lot of comments are missing to clarify what each line of code does.
